> Azure Dev Spaces allows you to test and iteratively develop your entire microservices application by running in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) without the need to replicate or mock dependencies. Azure Dev Spaces reduces the burden and complexity of collaborating with your team in a shared Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, as well as by running and debugging containers directly in AKS. Learn how to use Azure Dev Spaces by using these quickstarts.
