> GCP resources are the fundamental components that make up all Google Cloud services. Resources are organized hierarchically and help organize your work on GCP.
>
> Projects are the first level of the resource hierarchy, and they contain other low-level resources like Cloud Storage buckets and Compute Engine instances.

You can administrate your GCP resources with [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/) or with gcloud CLI.
